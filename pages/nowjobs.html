        <p>During my year at Nowjobs, I contributed to integrating numerous features for a <b>300-million-euro net worth company</b>, working closely with a small yet highly dedicated team. Together, we aimed to enhance operational efficiency and deliver a powerful toolset for <b>both B2B and B2C users</b>. My role involved implementing features in our <b>TypeScript</b> backend and leveraging tools like <b>MySQL, Datadog, and the entire Jira suite, among others.</b>
            <br><br>
            As an organization embarking on its first acquisition, our mission was to create a robust platform that seamlessly connected flexible workers with companies in need. This included everything from <b>developing sophisticated matching algorithms to digitizing legal processes</b>, such as work visas and certifications. Handling sensitive data daily, I became well-versed in <b>GDPR compliance</b> and data security best practices.</p>
